## What is it?

A simple, free Google Sheets and Google Forms solution to help Canadian small businesses enable curbside pickup for their products. The solution requires minimum setup and technical maintenance. 

In three simple steps, businesses can use this workflow to get a dynamically generated Google Form link that they on their website or social media channels. Businesses can then receive orders and communicate with their customers.

A detailed slide deck describing the solution is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRTQXAhwLvMtn09YRG0UEnyFQJMDwY1wpz41iSpwlOt0Ta1Hm61yEC3ACcsuk26UiQ_bKMEtRVywByM/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p "Curbside Pickup Slides").

## Who is it for?

Any business that is looking to pivot their customer strategy to include curbside pickup. By using curbside order pickup, customers can place orders online, and then collect them from the curbside of the establishment without entering the store. 

By automating this process, businesses will have clarity on when to expect customers, and manage customer flow for pick-up. 

This workflow is also helpful for not-for-profits that are requesting items in need, and can manage schedules and delivery drop-offs.
